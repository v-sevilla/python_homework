1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
Static visualizations are like still pictures or snapshots, whereas interactive visualizations give you the ability to see the data in different ways based on how you choose to view the data, like hovering to a specific plot point or clicking to find more details about a specific category.

2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
An advantage of using dashboards for real time data exploration is the ability to see data in live time. This means that the data is getting updated and refreshed frequently to represent data based on what is currently taking place.

3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.
I think interactive tools like Plotly and Dash are able to help us explore data that would highlight what we want it to demonstrate. For example, in a professional setting, having interactive visualization can help teams understand patterns and engage with data in a more meaningful way, especially with those who don't understand technical jargon.
